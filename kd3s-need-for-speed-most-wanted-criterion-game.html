Ok, first of all, this post is for those who, like me, have been playing the need for speed franchise ever since Need For Speed 1 came out and you had to play it on a crappy DOS computer. So before the downvotes begin, hear me out and try to understand why EA has FUCKED Need For Speed up for good and IMO it's beyond recovery. Ok so back in the day, we had some crappy computer graphics, some pixelated shit and so on, but games were FUN AS SHIT, I remember driving a Mercedez Продолжение серии Need for Speed - Most Wanted образца 2012-го года от студии Criterion Games, известной по серии Burnout.

MILD SPOILER WARNING Let me start by saying, I'm a major petrolhead and a game designer. But due to the absolutely horrendous execution of arcade racing games by a handful of studios that actually do make it, I have been deprived of playing the one genre I'd ideally be playing constantly, in a better universe.

This is my first post on r/gamedev but I've been designing games for over 10 years and I've always been interested in gathering as much information as possible about game development across all the disciplines. I typically scour the GDC talks as they come onto the vault each year, but every year there is more and more places to find good talks. So, I want to know, what are some of the best talks you've found, that you would recommend for other game developers?

I'm really on a nostalgia kick, and I've bought a couple copies of old NFS titles. Carbon and Most Wanted. I played them a lot as a kid, including Hot Pursuit 2, and I'm not sure if it's just my nostalgia for the older games talking, but I feel like none of the reboots ever got the same amount of exposure/attention that the originals had, and it seems like it would be a waste if my time to play them. I mean, that's how most reboots go, and I understand that for the most part they really This is probably a long shot but here it goes. I'm trying to use the camera mod with NFS MW 2012 . I copied the files and when I run the game I get the little configuration window, but when I press Play, the game closes itself during the Criterion intro (no error or anytning) . Is there No, I am not saying that from now on all NFS needs is cathatonic highly aggressive metal cuz "IT IZ FER RACING 11!!!11" even though I really want more metal music in NFS tbh) but let's be real. I always felt like ever since Ghost took over development duties for the NFS franchise, I have been noticing a dip in soundtrack quality. Yet, I still really liked soime songs from the Rivals soundtrack, with special mention to the more faster paced electronic tracks (and I Am Dust, that song kicks

For a quick summary, Criterion was originally a 3d graphics rendering technology company owned. One of the primary theoretical problems associated with common ownership of productive resources is the "tragedy of the commons". This post aims to explain a way in which the "tragedy of the commons" may be an oversimplified model for a large number of social games and to introduce a normative criterion for economically efficient use of the commons.

The Crew doesn't have a police system anymore, and the FH series never really had one to begin with. So, why is this a big deal? Well, to me nfs has one unique attribute left: its inclusion of police in its games. Without police, nfs becomes an obsolete franchise; forza horizon beats it with overall quality and quantity, the crew beats it with sheer scale. Meme Gear!

So the other day stopped by one of the Game Over Videogames shops here and finally got myself a 360. The 360 itself was , but after the 50% that makes it . Seems like a good price, but this is one of those old systems that doesn't have HDMI out. so I had to get me some component cables. And this is also one of those old systems that doesn't have a built in hard drive, so I had to get me one of those two. All these things were 50% off so whatever. Now that I think about it. I doubt.

Passives are innate powers/bonuses that all Warframes have. These powers, on the contrary of the others possessed by the ‘frames, do not usually need energy to be used (with some exceptions), but are innate and “always” (kind of) active. Every ‘frame has at least one. Some of them are simple boosts in stats when using specific loadouts/powers, others are more convolute mechanics. This work of mine has the intention to evaluate the ones we have and to give, when necessary, suggestions to improve. G’day frens! I love you Ghost, you guys are some of the most listening and feedback-taking I’ve ever seen from a developer team. Hats off to you! Payback had its strengths but it certainly wasn’t what I and many others wanted. It is truly understandable tho. NFS has been through an identity crisis for over a decade. It isn’t your fault either! Fanbase is divided, NFS has been through so many iterations that we don’t know what makes a “true” Need For Speed. Myself, my love for cars and car cultu. 
Generic: In November 2005, an innovative western shooter from Neversoft was released and it was positively well-received, and it's titled. Gun . Yeah, couldn't be more generic than that! The contender of the most generic game ever would be The Club , an underground blood sport TPS from Bizarre Creations. Can anybody think a better name for this? There are two games that were titled Need for Speed Most Wanted (2005) and Need for Speed Most Wanted (2012) I have been a need for speed addict since release of underground one. I've played and finished every single campaign in u1,u2 ,mw ,carbon, rivals and recently payback. I also played original series nfs1,2 but not so much, feels repetitive back then :'), and enjoyed nfs world for a little bit. most of those times, the game touched me emotionally through different pieces of storyline (that I think it is in deed connected!), and attracted me to stay and play for hours and hours. so I fairly consid. </p>
